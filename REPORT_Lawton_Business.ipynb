    "### Lawton, Oklahoma is a rapidly rising city with a population of 120,000 people. The fourth largest city in the State of Oklahoma. One of the most diverse cities in the country. The military is the most populous group in Lawton. Many small, medium, and big businesses cater to various needs associated to a largely military city's major occupation. Many soldiers leave the military while stationed in Lawton. Furthermore, it looks that the military base is planning to expand. In this city, there are numerous options to start a business."
